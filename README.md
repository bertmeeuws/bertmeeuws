### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Bert
I have a passion for software development, currently I am employed at In The Pocket in Ghent.
A digital product studio where I am working on a big cloud project.

At work I am using: Typescript, Golang, AWS and Terraform

Currently I am learning functional programming in Scala.
Now focusing on the typelevel stack (http4s, doobie, cats-effect, cats), after I have mastered the typelevel stack I'll create a hobby project in the ZIO stack.
